This project is a low-cost automatic pet feeder designed to feed cats and dogs reliably at scheduled times. 
It uses a servo motor to dispense food, sensors to monitor the food bin and the pet's bowl, and an alert system to notify if something goes wrongâ€”like food not being dispensed or pets not eating.

## Features
- Scheduled Feeding:** Set feeding times and portion sizes for your pets.
- Bowl & Bin Monitoring:** Tracks bowl weight before, after dispensing, and after eating to confirm consumption.
- Servo Motor Dispensing:** Releases food precisely at the scheduled times.
- Alerts: Notifies if there is a problem with dispensing or consumption.
  
## Components
- Servo Motor
- Real-Time Clock (RTC)
- Food Level Sensor
- Weight Sensor
- Alert System (LED)

## How It Works
- Initialize system with feeding times and portion sizes.
- Read sensors: current time, food bin level, bowl weight.
- heck if it's feeding time and activate the servo motor.
- asure bowl weight after dispensing and after eating to confirm pets ate the food.
- trigger alerts if any issue is detected.

## Future Improvements
- Mobile or web dashboard for remote monitoring.
